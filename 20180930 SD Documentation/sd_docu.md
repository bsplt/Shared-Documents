## Description

A membrane separates _a_ from the rest of the world. That's the story of the Suspended Desire Machine. _a_ is constrained, someone put in a box. _a_ cant do anything. Except waiting. It waits for you, to turn it on, to be turned on. Take a seat, hit the switch. Watch. Closely. Don't touch. Leave it running, if that's what you desire. The Suspended Desire Machine is not a furniture, it's a factory.

## Abstract

## Concept

In an uncanny way I am an admirer of the French author Michel Houellebecq. I would never consider myself a fan of anything, but in his case I would admit I get quite enthusiastic about each new book. The fiction of Michel Houellebecq actually interests me because there is much to reflect upon. Here is why. The characters in Houellebecq's novels are exclusively white males of mid age with an dispirited attitude towards their impotent existence. They urge to compensate this discrepancy by excessive outgrowths of their mostly burdensome traits. The novels are written in a state of prosperity in Western and Central Europe where for a share of the demography the only glass ceiling that is left is the nihilistic confrontation with their own transience. No values left to believe in and nothing to do. They live and die alone. Therefore the characters in Houellebecq's novel consequently develop some cringeworthy habits. Worth mentioning that a lot of these habits have to do with sexuality, which is the context of my work. Occuring examples would be swinger clubs or sex tourism. I was interested in another practice though that I am going to explain later.

While I was conceptualizing an idea for the seminar to work on I was also reading a book about Jacques Lacan by Slavoj Žižek ("How to Read Lacan"). I learned about a concept called the Big Other. Lacan would abbreviate it as "A" since he is a constant user of algebraic notation. The Big Other can appear for example in the shape of god, the law or societal expectations. Generally these are topics we perceive to be of an almost metaphysical validity. Therefore Lacan uses the term "other" in Big Other, because we tend to situate these concepts in an realm outside of our control. But Lacan was a psychoanalyst and very well aware that the distinction is only imaginary. We might be able to look at society as an emergent feature but still it is immanent to human behavior as such and arises from human psyche. What does that mean? We experience the Big Other as something separate then what we experience as "I" and we are in a constant dialog with it was we are negotiating our terms of being. The Big Other only alters itself through value shifts in society and not by individual contemplation but still can only be split from the rest of the psyche conceptually by outside observers (psychoanalysts). Eventually this means that all the societal and social fears we have are created only by the individual itself through negotiation with the Big Other, even though the expectations that will lead to fears are coded into the Big Other through society.

After reading it for a couple of times this concept stuck with me and formed a picture that serves as an analogy. I was thinking of a membrane that separates both spheres from each other, the "I" and the Big Other, yet through its elasticity both form one shape together. A change in the medium on one side of the membrane will affect the medium on the other side indirectly and inevitably. Both are separate but one.

While studying Houellebecq again I found his depiction of the BDSM culture quite interesting. Houellebecq himself states that he finds sadomasochistic practices both physically and morally disgusting. But his characters tend to have another opinion. Some of them would suggest that sexuality as a social institution will find it last step in a Sade-like system or that BDSM is only a subcultural surrogate for conventional "vanilla" sexuality. In the novel "Platform" though a protagonist makes a profound observation while being in a BDSM club with a couple of rubber fetishists. Wearing latex, the more the better, puts an artificial buffer between humans so skin doesn't have to touch anymore. It's almost not like there is a medium in between the bodies because latex is some form of a new skin. The rubber is tight and elastic so it follows the surface of the body perfectly. There is an artificial separation between human bodies in the practice of rubber fetishism. Instead of skin touching skin there is something that takes over the act of applying physical forces to each other which strongly reminded me of the idea of the membrane I developed before.

As sexuality also is part of the Big Other and arises from expectations I found this coincidence to be quite intriguing thrilling to think about. Even though I didn't even want to make an attempt into forming a consistent theoretical concept out of my vague ideas it served as a starting that was interesting enough for me to investigate this further through artistic practice.

## Process

I had an idea of a membrane made from latex which I wanted to investigate with this work. The membrane should have been mounted on a construction made of steel beams, similar to the structures just in BDSM practices. So there would have been a surface that could be modulated through applying forces locally, hence changing the tension and the curvature. As artificiality was an integral part of my concept I got the idea to incorporate robots into the installation that I had in mind. I imagined a huge sheet of latex stretch over a couple of robot arms that poke the latex from beneath.

So I went into fabricating latex sheets, because they are quite expensive, which was quite a smelly experience, and I started thinking about robots. I came up with a structure that uses two motors on a base axis and provides two degrees of freedom on a polar coordinate system. The kinematics are based on a parallelogram and enabled me to come up with a simple design that I could easily prototype with PMMA, a couple of screws and laser cutting. I never really worked on robotics before but this architecture was quite manageable for me. So I started developing a prototype software for the inverse kinematics that I needed to animate the robotic movement. Instead of telling each motor how to move the software should be able to receive a point in two-dimensional space and move the motors in a way so that the arm moves to that position.

The next step would have been to write an animation software that lets the effector (tip of the robot arm) follow predefined splines. I programmed something similar later on, but not for this robot.
